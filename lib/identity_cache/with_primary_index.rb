      # == Example:
      #
      #  class Product
      #    include IdentityCache
      #    cache_index :name, :vendor
      #  end

      #
      #   Product.fetch_by_name_and_vendor
      #   Product.fetch_multi_by_name_and_vendor
      #
      # == Parameters
      #
      # +fields+ Array of symbols or strings representing the fields in the index
      #
      # == Options
      # * unique: if the index would only have unique values. Default is false
