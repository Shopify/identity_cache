## 0.5.1

- Fix bug in prefetch_associations for cache_has_one associations that may be nil

## 0.5.0

- `never_set_inverse_association` and `fetch_read_only_records` are now `true` by default (#315)
- Store the class name instead of the class itself (#311)

## 0.4.1

- Deprecated embedded associations on models that don't use IDC (#305)
- Remove a respond_to? check that hides mistakes in includes hash (#307)
- Drop ruby 2.1 support (#301)
- Avoid querying when no ids are passed to fetch_multi (#297)

- Move `should_use_cache?` calls to the model-level (#291)
- Clone instead of dup record when readonlyifying fetched records (#292)
- Consistently store the array for cached has many associations (#288)

## 0.4.0

- Return an array from fetched association to prevent chaining. Up to now, a relation was returned by default. (#287)

## 0.3.2

- Deprecate returning non read-only records when cache is used. Set IdentityCache.fetch_readonly_records to true to avoid this. (#282)
- Use loaded association first when fetching a cache_has_many id embedded association (#280)
- Deprecate setting the inverse active record association on cache hits. Set IdentityCache.never_set_inverse_association to true to avoid this. (#279)
- Fetch association returns relation or array depending on the configuration. It was only returning a relation for cache_has_many fetch association methods. (#276)
- Stop sharing the same attributes hash between the fetched record and the memoized cache, which could interfere with dirty tracking (#267)

## 0.3.1

- Fix cache_index for non-id primary key

## 0.3.0

- Use ActiveRecord instantiate

- Fix N+1 from fetching embedded ids on a cache miss
- Raise when trying to cache a through association. Previously it wouldn't be invalidated properly.
- Raise if a class method is called on a scope.  Previously the scope was ignored.
